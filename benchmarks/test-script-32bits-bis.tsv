#Those data have been generated by the script:

#This test has been run on a curve of with the following j-invariant j=39
#and defined on the Finite Field of cardinality p=2147483693, 
#we took the curve of cardinality 2147505280, 
#with beta=2 and the height of the volcano: h=2. 						
#p=2147483693 j=39 cardinality=2147505280 beta=2 h=2						
#timing is in s, k represents the valuation of the 2 torsion 
#we had to compute for the algorithm.			
#The timing has been decomposed in 3 steps 
#the two first one (tate and initialisation) are precomputations, 
#the last one is the interpolation try which is repeated O(2**(2*k)) times, 
#thus the most relevant for the analysis.
